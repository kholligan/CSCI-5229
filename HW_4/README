# Homework 4: Projections

Kevin Holligan
CSCI 5229 Fall 2016

3D scene of Newton's cradle, using a custom sphere function for the balls, a cylinder function for the "string" attachment and rectangles for the bars. Will eventually create a more complex shape and expand on the bars to have rounded edges.

To build and run:
```
make
./hw4
```

Key bindings
  0   Reset scene to 0
  1   Change the mode to perspective
  2   Change the mode to orthogonal
  w   Move forward in first person in perspective
  s   Move backwards in first person in perspective
  d   Strafe right in perspective
  a   Strafe left in perspective
  q   Look down in perspective
  z   Look up in perspective
  e   Look right in perspective
  c   Look left in perspective
  m   Increase the fov
  n   decrease the fov
  o   Decrease the dim
  p   Increase the dims
  arrows Change view angle
  ESC    Exit

Time to complete: 10 hours. Spent time redrawing the 3D objects to draw newton's cradle. Spent about 6 hours reading tutorials and learning how to strafe in perspective.
