# Homework 5: Lighting

Kevin Holligan
CSCI 5229 Fall 2016

3D scene of Newton's cradle, with custom function to draw cylinders as the "strings"/"wires" and rectangular bars with rounded edges. Lighting effects added and ambient/diffuse/specular effects added to the sphere.

Use 1, 2, and 3 to view different "scenes" which allow you to easily view the lighting effects on the drawn objects.

To build and run:
```
make
./hw5
```

Key bindings
  0   Reset scene to 0
  1   View scene 1
  2   View scene 2
  3   View whole scene
  l   Toggle lighting
  m   Toggle movement of light
  <>  Move the light
  []  Lower/raise light
  p   Toggle ortho/perspective mode
  +/- Change field of view
  PgDn/PgUp Increase/Decrease dim
  arrows Change view angle
  ESC    Exit

Time to complete: 14 hours. Spent time drawing the cylinders and the rounded edges (about 8 hours). Spent time trying to figure out what the cylinder normals were and then why they were not smoothing the light around the actual cylinder when I first tried to use (cos(theta), sin(theta), 0).
